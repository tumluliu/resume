This is my CV in HTML format. The pdf version is generated with OSX system printer with 72% shrinked option.

The CSS template is from [Simple-Responsive-Resume-HTML](https://github.com/fuzzywalrus/Simple-Responsive-Resume-HTML-CSS) project made by [Greg Gant](http://blog.greggant.com/about). Thanks very much, Greg!
